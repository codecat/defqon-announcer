# Defqon.1 2017 Announcer

A livestream announcer Discord bot for Defqon.1 2017. Announces when streamed sets are about to start (5 minutes before) and when they are live. Also has a few commands:

* `.current` will tell you what the current playing set is.
* `.next` will tell you what the next set is, and when.

The stream schedule is taken from [here](http://imgur.com/a/8p4dH) and manually converted into a `schedule.yaml` file.
