# Q-BASE 2017 Announcer

A livestream announcer Discord bot for Q-BASE 2017. Announces when streamed sets are about to start (5 minutes before) and when they are live. Also has a few commands:

* `.current` will tell you what the current playing set is.
* `.next` will tell you what the next set is, and when.
* `.schedule` will tell you what the next 5 sets will be, and when.

The stream schedule is taken from [here](https://i.imgur.com/aFZhjVI.jpg) and manually converted into a `schedule.yaml` file.
